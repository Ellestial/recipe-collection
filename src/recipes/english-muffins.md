1. In large mixer bowl, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour, the bread flour, yeast, sugar, and salt; mix well. Add warm water (120-130°F) and shortening to flouor mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. 

2. By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a firm dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled, 45 to 60 minutes.

3. Punch down dough. On surface sprinkled with flour, roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness. With biscuit or cookie cutter, cut into 3 or 4-inch circles. Coat cookie sheets with a thin layer of cornmeal. Place muffins on these cookie sheets. Cover; let rise at room temperature until double, about 30 minutes. While they are rising, preheat electric griddle to 325°F.

4. Bake on lightly oiled electric griddle for about 8 minutes on each side until deep golden brown. Cool.
