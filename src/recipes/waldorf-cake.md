#### Cake

1. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well. Add vanilla and vinegar.
2. In a separate medium bowl, mix flour, soda, salt and cocoa. Add to creamed mixture alternating with buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.
Beat for 3 minutes more. Butter and flour two 8 inch round cake pans.
Bake at 350Â°F for about 30 minutes. If making a 9" x 13" sheet cake, bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Wait until the cake has cooled to room temperature before adding the frosting.

#### Frosting

1. In a small saucepan, cook milk and flour on medium heat, stirring with a whisk. As it gets thick, beat with the whisk to prevent lumps from forming. Once thickened, remove from heat and cover top of mixture with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming. Cool until almost room temperature. Place in the refrigerator until it is almost cold.
2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer until it is light and fluffy. Gradually add sugar, beating well after each addition. Beat for 10 more minutes. Gradually add the flour/milk mixture and vanilla with the electric mixer to the sugar/butter mixture. Beat well after each addition. after all of the flour/milk mixture is beaten in, continue beating a few minutes more. The frosting should be creamy and fluffy. You should not feel any grains of sugar. The frosting should be smooth.
