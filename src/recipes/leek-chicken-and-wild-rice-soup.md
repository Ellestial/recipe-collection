1. Trim the leeks, leaving the white and light-green parts. Slice in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick half-moon slices to yield about 3-1/2 cups. Rinse well, then pat dry.
2. Heat the oil in a 5- to 7-quart Dutch oven or other wide heavy pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, fennel, and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
3. Add the rice, garlic, paprika, 1/2 tsp. salt, and a generous pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the rice is just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken and celery leaves, and cook until the chicken is just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Garnish with the fennel fronds, if you like.
