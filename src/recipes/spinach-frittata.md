1. Using a large frying pan, saute green onions and garlic in oil just until glazed. Add spinach and break apart with a spatula or spoon.

2. Beat eggs and mix in salt, pepper, parsley, and half of the cheese. Pour in the egg mixture and cook over medium-low heat without stirring until the eges are lightly browned.

3. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and slip under the broiler to brown the top lightly. Cut into wedges to serve.
