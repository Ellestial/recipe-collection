#### Pastry

1. Preheat oven to 350°F and prepare filling.

2. In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt; mix well.

3. In a saucepan, heat milk, water, and butter until warm (120-130°F; butter does not need to melt). Add to flour mixure. Add eggs. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. 

4. By hand, gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 1 hour.

5. Punch down dough. Divide into 2 parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half to a 15x12-inch rectangle. Spread with filling. Starting with longer side, roll up tightly. Pinch edges to seal. Form ring, pinch ends to seal. Place each ring, seam side down, on a greased cookie sheet. With scissors, make cuts 1 inch apart through top of ring to 1 inch from center. Turn each slice on its side. Cover; let rise in warm place until almost doubled, about 20 minutes.

6. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheets; cool. Drizzle with powdered sugar glaze, if desired.
