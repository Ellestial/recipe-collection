1. Sift flour with baking soda and salt. In a medium-sized bowl beat softened butter with peanut butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar. When creamy, beat in egg and vanilla. Add flour mixture half at a time, beating well after each addition.

2. Heat oven to 375Â°F. Put remaining granulated sugar on a piece of wax paper. Shape dough into 1-inch balls, using a heaping teaspoonful for each. Roll balls in granulated sugar and place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 10 minutes.

3. Remove from oven and press a chocolate kiss lightly into the top of each cookie. Return to oven and bake 2 to 4 minutes longer, until cookies eare lightly browned. Remove cookies from oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool.
