## Ingredients
  + 1-1/2 lb. leeks (about 2 large)
  + 3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
  + 2 cups finely chopped fresh fennel (from 1 large bulb; fronds reserved for garnish, if you like)
  + 1/2 cup finely chopped celery plus 1/2 cup coarsely chopped celery leaves
  + 1/3 cup jasmine rice
  + 1 clove garlic, finely chopped
  + 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika
  + Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  + 6 cups lower-salt chicken broth
  + 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast, each breast cut into thirds lengthwise, then thinly sliced crosswise
  + Fresh lemon juice, to taste

## Preparation
Trim the leeks, leaving the white and light-green parts. Slice in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick half-moon slices to yield about 3-1/2 cups. Rinse well, then pat dry.

Heat the oil in a 5- to 7-quart Dutch oven or other wide heavy pot over medium heat. Add the leeks, fennel, and celery, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Add the rice, garlic, paprika, 1/2 tsp. salt, and a generous pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the rice is just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the chicken and celery leaves, and cook until the chicken is just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Garnish with the fennel fronds, if you like.
