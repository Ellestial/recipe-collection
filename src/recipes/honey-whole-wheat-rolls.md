1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, yeast, and salt; mix well.

2. In a saucepan, combine milk, water, shortening, and honey and heat until warm to the touch (120-130°F). Note the shortening may not fully melt. Pour over the flour mixture. Add egg. With a hand mixer, blend at low speed until moistened, then at medium speed for 3 minutes.

3. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour. By hand, stir together until a firm dough forms. If needed, add up to 1/2 cup more all-purpose flour. Knead for 5-8 minutes until elastic. Roll into a ball and add to a large greased bowl. Flip so both sides get greased. Cover; let rise in a warm area 45-60 minutes until double in size.

4. Preheat oven to 375°F. Punch dough down and divide into 4 pieces. Take each piece and roll into a long rope. Cut into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and, as needed, stretch the dough under itself to help make a more rounded ball. Add each ball to a greased cookie sheet. Cover; rise for 20-30 minutes. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
