ingredients:

- 1 yolk from a medium or large egg
- 2 cups chopped walnuts

1. Prepare and bake the Classic Shortbread as directed.  While it is cooking, mix the light brown sugar, syrup, flour, and the egg yolk in a small bowl.

2. When the shortbread is lightly browned, remove the pans from the oven and spread half of the syrup mixture evenly over the top of each. Sprinkle the chopped nuts all over the syrup mixture, being sure to cover the surface thickly. Gently press the nuts into the topping.

3. Return the pans to the oven and continue baking an additional 15 to 20 minutes. I know it seems as though you might burn the shortbread underneath the topping if you bake it this much longer, but you won't.

4. As soon as you remove the pans from the oven, run a knife around the edge of the shortbread. Let the shortbread cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Again, run the knife around the edge of the pans to loosen the shortbread.
