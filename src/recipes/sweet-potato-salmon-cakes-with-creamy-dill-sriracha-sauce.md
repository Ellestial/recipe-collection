#### Sweet Potato Salmon Cakes

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Combine all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.
3. Using 1/3 cup measuring cup, scoop batter and shape into 7 cakes. It is easier to work with batter if your hands are slightly damp.
4. Sauté cakes 3-5 minutes on each side. I had to do this in two batches and added another tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet for my 2nd batch.
5. Once lightly browned on both sides, remove from skillet and transfer to paper towel lined plate.

#### Creamy Dill Sriracha Sauce

1. Simply combine all ingredients in a small bowl. Enjoy!

#### Balsamic Maple Brussels Sprouts

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF. Line baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray or line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
2. Toss Brussels in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread evenly on baking sheet and bake for 20 mins.
3. Remove from oven and toss in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, balsamic vinegar and maple syrup. Serve immediately.

#### Notes
*Alternatively, use 2 (5 ounce) cans salmon or tuna. The salmon is to be cooked before making patties. I pan-seared my salmon according to the method, detailed in this recipe. It makes for such wonderful salmon. I did not use the seasoning recipe in the recipe, but only seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper. 

**Roast sweet potato at 400ºF. for about 45-60 mins and until soft.
