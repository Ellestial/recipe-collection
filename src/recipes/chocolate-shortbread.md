1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Cream the butter. Cream in the powdered sugar, cocoa, and vanilla. Now work in the flour. Knead the dough on an unfloured surface until it is nice and smooth. The dough shouldn't be crumbly.

2. Spray your shortbread pan very lightly wih a non-stick vegetable oil spray. Put the ball of dough in the middle of the pan, and working out from the center, firmly press the dough into the pan. Prick the entire surface with a fork, and bake the shortbread right in the pan for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is lightly browned. Be sure that the middle is thoroughly cooked and doesen't look slightly opaque or the shortbread might stick in the pan.

3. Let the shortbread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before you loosen the edges with a knife and flip the pan over onto a cutting board. If the shortbread doesn't come right out, hold the pan upside down over the cutting board and firmly tap one edge of the pan against the board. This should loosen the shortbread and it should drop out. Cut the shortbread into serving pieces while it is still warm.
