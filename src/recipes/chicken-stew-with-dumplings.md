#### Soup

1. In Dutch oven or kettle place chicken pieces. Add the 4 cups water, celery, carrots, onions, salt, thyme, and pepper. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 35 to 45 minutes or till chicken is nearly tender. Skim off fat.

2. Blend the 1 cup cold water and the flour; stir into chicken mixture. Stir in undrained mushrooms. Cook, stirring gently, till thickened and bubbly. Drop Herb Dumpling dough from tablespoon to make 8 mounds atop bubbling stew. Cover and simmer 15 minutes (do not lift cover). Sprinkle chicken and dumplings with the snipped parsley.

#### Herb Dumplings

1. In a medium mixing bowl, thoroughly stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, and dried thyme or sage. In another bowl, combine the dairy sour cream, the milk, and the cooking oil or melted shortening. Add the sour cream mixture all at once to the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl; stir just till all dry ingredients are thoroughly moistened.

2. Drop the dumpling dough from a tablespoon to make 8 mounds atop the bubbling soup or stew. Reduce the heat; cover and simmer the dumplings for about 15 minutes (do not lift cover).
