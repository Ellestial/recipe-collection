1. Rinse uncooked wild rice in a strainer under cold water for 1 minute; drain. In a large saucepean combine wild rice, broth, wine, uncooked brown rice (if using), and poultry seasoning. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 40 minutes or until rice is tender. If using, add white rice the last 20 minutes of cooking time. If necessary, drain any remaining liquid.

2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet cook mushrooms, carrots, onions, and sweet pepper in hot butter over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in pine nuts, cheese, salt, and black pepper. Stir vegetable mixture into wild rice mixture. Serve immediately.

3. **To Make Ahead:** Prepare as directed. Transfer stuffing to a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Cool. Cover; chill for up to 24 hours. To serve, preheat oven to 350Â°F. If necessary, stir in 1/4 to 1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth to moisten mixture. Bake, covered, about 30 minutes or until heated through.
