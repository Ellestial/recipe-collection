1. Heat oven to 450Â°F. Prepare pie crust according to package directions for unfilled one-crust pie using 9-inch pie pan. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely.

2. In medium saucepan combine sugar, salt, and cornstarch, blend well. Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat until mixture boils, stirring constantly. Reserve 1 tablespoon chocolate chips for topping. Add remaining chocolate chips, butter, and vanilla, stirring until melted and smooth. Pour into small mixing bowl; cover surface with plastic wrap. Cool to room temperature.

3. In large bowl, combine whipping cream and powdered sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Reserve 2 1/2 cups for topping. Beat cooled chocolate mixture at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Fold chocolate mixture into whipped cream. Spoon evenly into cooled, baked crust. Top with reserved whipping cream. Chop reserved chocolate chips, sprinkle over top.
