ingredients:

- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil

1. Place each chicken breast half between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; pound to 1/2-inch thickness using a meat mallet or small, heavy skillet. Sprinkle chicken evenly with salt and pepper.

2. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, cook 6 minutes on each side or until done. Remove chicken from pan, keep warm.

3. Add garlic to pan; cook 1 minute, stirry constantly. Add broth and herbes de Provence; bring to a boil, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Cook until broth mixture is reduced to 1/2 cup (about 3 minutes). Remove from heat; add lemon juice and butter, stirring until butter melts. Serve sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.
